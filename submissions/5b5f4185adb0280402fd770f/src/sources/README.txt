I will be mentioned as max powers in the final results.

I have been a browser JS developer for over 5 years.
I am new to es6 so most of my JS code is written in an older style
that would run in an older browser.

My main plan for the script is to not be greedy.
I would rather walk away from the deal with some money
even if it is less than what I wanted.
I would rather accept $4 than walk away with $0 even if the opponent gets $10.
I chose this method because I am hoping to get a higher score by
making the most deals. I want to get a little money from every game,
and have it add up over many games.

My first offer is always to get $10, but I always offer the
opponent the items I think are worth $0.
The next round, I give up the cheepest item.
I continue to give up the cheepest item until we reach a deal.

If I am offered a good deal, close to $10, I take it.
If it is the last round I lower what I will accept to about $4.
