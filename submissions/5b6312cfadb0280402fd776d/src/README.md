# My Solution
Hey!
It the simple bot wich should be more efficiently than the `example.js`
* In each round it gives one thing if this is justified
* In addition, it cheks the counter offers, if it is profitable, it keep it in array.
* If the current offer is more than 80% of the total worth, it will be immediately accepted
### The last round. 
* If now my move, it send best offer from the array.
* If no, sends the standard bid

**Thanks!!**
