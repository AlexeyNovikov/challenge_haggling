There will be lots of smart algorithms that will enter this competition.
This is not one of them.

There will be people that will use reinforce learning. There will be people that will look at the offers they are receiving and, based on the history, determine what the opponent's values are. There will be people that will actually offer a different object type of the same value, instead of just insisting on the same, last counter offer they are making. 
Everybody knows what needs to be done in order to make a smart algorithm that actually tries to offer lots of value for the opponent, but a little more value than that for themselves.
So my algorithm should be a little different than the standard approach in order to have the slightest chance to win: be dumb, don't diversify my offers and request a lot of value for myself.

Also, this solution takes full advantage of the [default parameters that will be used in the competition](https://github.com/hola/challenge_haggling/commit/7f838e3bc00081f13bbc41639053d1ed8268f903#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8R81). It should "work" with any parameter values, but definitely not that good.


(I'm well aware that the source code is horrible. I will clean it up if requested.)
