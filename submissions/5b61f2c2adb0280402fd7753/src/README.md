The original js file is not minified/obfuscated and contains log stuff and comments.

A simple strategy with some arbitrary coefficients.

Main features:
- Never accept first deal, unless it's a very generous offer
- Honesty: never ask for worthless items, never ask for all the items (the last is pointless against any sensible strategy).
- On the last round either soften the demands and accept less profitable deals or make a most sensible offer, that came from the other side.

All the other nuances can be grokked via reading comments and log calls in the js file itself

My prediction is somwhere from "top 75%" to "top 25%" in the current challenge for the current strategy.

UPD: After the preliminary standings studying, the coefficients were tweaked a bit. Not the best idea TBH.
