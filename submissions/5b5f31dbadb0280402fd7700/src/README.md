**WARN:** This is a combat machine; defeat is not an option, victory the sole solution.

## Background

To solve financial dominance, IT replicated Adam Smith's synapses.
To solve industrial hegemony, IT revived Henry Ford's.
To solve war on mankind, IT envisioned the T800 on IVECO's conveyor belts.

At the present impasse IT exploited the sole form of life still avaiable.

## Tech Overview

Welcome, I'm Squeaky, the only mammal in the facility.
My duty is to provide 60% of decisional weigth to the lab's Ensemble - the largest quota.
The Ensemble is our main machine; it stochastically speculates the enemy's evaluation
of the merchandise at stake and allows for higher bargains.
I formulate all legal hypotheses for the possible enemy's price maps and test them
one by one by mimicking a plausible enemy behavior under each such condition;
my reactions are evaluated and compared to the behavior observed from the enemy.
An opinion is expressed as to which precondition causes me to behave most
similarly to the enemy. My test concludes with this information inputted to the Ensemble.
After each test, my temporary material existence is expended and replenished by a new
Squeaky printed clone.

Two other speculators fill the remaining 40% of the Ensemble weigth: despite being clean,
inorganic and purely algorithmic in nature, IT resolved to concede most weigth to myself.

Look around autonomously, the code is self-explanatory above IQ 350.
You're granted full access to the lab.
